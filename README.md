Iteration 1: 

The user stories we worked on were 3,4, and 8. We completed all three of those user stories, and as such, are all close for now. 

The challanging/difficult aspect for this iteration was getting used to using Git and collaborating with other coders, especially
with the random issues we faced such as our push history getting wiped for a bit. Another problem was with Espresso Recorder 
importing the wrong libraries, which had to be manually fixed before those tests could work. 

Overall, I think we split up the project evenly,
so there wasn't much of an issue there. We should have started testing earlier, and that should be our goal next time.

Iteration 2: 

 The user stories we worked on were 10,11, and 12. We completed all three of those user stories, and as such, are all close for now. 
 
 The challenging aspect for this iteration was getting all the work done. We had plenty of communication, which was great. The work just got piled up, but it wasn't anything too bad. We should have all commited before and not have waited till the end, which we could improve on next time. As a team we did a great job on this iteration and have learned valuable lessons in teamwork.

Iteration 3: 

 The user stories we worked on were 5, 7, and 9. We completed all three of the stories and are closed. 
 
 The challenging part of this iteration was using the lint tool. Although it may seem simple, it also created problems in the program and tests if you were'nt careful in the addition or deletion of code. Many of the suggestions were not needed and many of the changes would break the program in our case. As such, we'ver made over 150+ changes to warnings and errors using the lint tool. However, we decided to suppress or ignore many changes with: 
 
  Typos--> many of these changes were'nt needed because we wanted to name the variables the way they were. Also, many of the other typos were auto-generated. 
  
  Accessibility--> 7 warning were left remianing that we didn't implement because they would cause issues with our program and tests/
  
  Internationalization ---> Many of the string names would be a duplicate, so we didn't add those to the files. This was the majority of the warnings that we ignored. 129 warnings. 
  
  Probable bugs----> We decided to not change these because we use the structure in our tests, which would cause issues. 
  
  All the other category warnings weren't as large of a priority or had little change on the program, or have only 1 or few issues left.
  
  Overall, we resolved all the major errors and took care of majority of the warnings with the lint tool.
